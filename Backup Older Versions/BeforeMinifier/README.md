## Web Design
For the course Web Design I (DM3000), We were requested for the semester project to construct a website of our choice that would be responsive.

# Goals for the website
Iâ€™m a Communication System student from EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland). My idea would be to build a presentation website. Something very simple and flat (in term of design) to present myself and link some of the important documents or Social networks. The idea would be to be able to put this website as a mail signature and let my friends, family, collaborators access it to gain access to what I do. Something simple, containing all links to my Resume, my LinkedIn, gitHub. I think it would be a good way to present myself, kind of like an Online resume. Not being a designer or Art student might be a difficulty but photoshop will be my friends to design it.
